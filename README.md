# Competitve Programming Parser for Sublime Text

This is a Sublime Text package for parsing problem test-cases from various online judges. You can then run your solution against the testcases with the help of [CppFastOlympicCoding](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/CppFastOlympicCoding). The list of supported websites can be found [here](https://github.com/jmerle/competitive-companion#supported-websites).

Competitive Programming Parser can:

-   parse testcases for a problem
-   parse a problem : creates file and parses testcases for the problem
-   parse a contest : parses all the problems of a contest

-   [FastOlympicCoding](https://github.com/Jatana/FastOlympicCoding)

<u><b>Setup</b></u>

<u><b>Some Common Pitfalls</b></u>

-   Windows users should make sure that ```tests_file_suffix``` is set to same value in the settings file of our package and [CppFastOlympicCoding](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/CppFastOlympicCoding). In [CppFastOlympicCoding](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/CppFastOlympicCoding), ```tests_file_suffix``` is by default set to ```:tests```. The problem with this is that ```:``` is not allowed in filename on windows. Fix is to override it to ```__tests```(which is also the default value of ```tests_file_suffix``` in our package.) in the user settings file of [CppFastOlympicCoding](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/CppFastOlympicCoding).
